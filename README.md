# Signal-Generator

Using STM32L476RG design a signal generator capable of generating a sine wave, square wave and triangle wave whose amplitudes should range between 0 to 3.3V and frequency between 10Hz to 100kHz. The user should be able to give the type of wave, the frequency and voltage limits as input.
